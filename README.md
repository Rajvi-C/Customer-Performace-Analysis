# Customer Performance Analysis 

The following project is to analyze the Customer Performance using the Adventure Works Dataset. I have created the Dashboard using PowerBI and made it dynamic using DAX. 

### Key Business Questions
1. Discover how to calculate the average age of your customers.
2. Learn the steps to determine the total count of your customer base.
3. Master the art of categorizing your customers based on their total orders and purchases. We'll identify VIP Customers, Loyal Customers, and Periodic Buyers.
4. Explore how to analyze revenue based on whether your customers have children or not, gaining critical insights into their preferences.
5. Implement a dynamic ranking system to identify and celebrate your top-performing customers, boosting your business strategies.
6. Gain valuable insights into revenue trends by examining customer gender.

The above dashboard is made in 2 modes ** Light ** and ** Dark **
